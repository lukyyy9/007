# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the React Native application.

## Required Files

The following files are referenced in app.json but need to be created:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (32x32)

## Placeholder Files

For development purposes, you can create simple placeholder images or use the default Expo assets.

To generate these assets, you can:
1. Use Expo's asset generation tools
2. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
3. Use online icon generators

## Usage

These assets are automatically bundled with the app and referenced in the app configuration.
